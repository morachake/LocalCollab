# LocalCollab

## Overview

**LocalCollab** is a local-first collaboration tool that allows users to create, edit, and share documents seamlessly—even when offline. This project aims to provide a user-friendly platform for real-time collaboration with data stored locally and synced when online. It uses **React** for the frontend and **Node.js** for the backend, providing a simple but robust foundation for building collaborative tools. 

## Key Features

- **Local-First Approach**: Allows users to work on documents even when offline, with data synced to the server when online.
- **Real-time Collaboration**: (Planned) Enables multiple users to collaborate on documents in real-time.
- **Cross-Platform**: Can be accessed from any device with a web browser.
- **Data Sync**: (Planned) Uses CRDTs (Conflict-free Replicated Data Types) to resolve conflicts and ensure smooth data synchronization.
- **Secure**: All data remains in the user’s local storage until a sync is initiated.

## Tech Stack

### Frontend:
- **React** - For building the user interface.
- **React Router** - For handling navigation within the app.
- **Styled Components** - For styling the components.

### Backend:
- **Node.js** - JavaScript runtime for the backend.
- **Express** - Minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework.
- **SQLite** - A lightweight database for local storage on the server.

### Future Enhancements:
- **IndexedDB** - For offline data storage on the client-side.
- **CRDTs** - To enable seamless real-time collaboration.
- **Service Workers** - For PWA support, making the app usable offline.
